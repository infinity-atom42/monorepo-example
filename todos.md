# Reminders

## High Priority

- [ ] based on the url changes the table is updated. Need an implementation for that.
- [ ] the table makes a main api call for the data but for the metadata it makes a second api call so it can be cached
- [ ] don't forget to invalidate cache with updateTag
- [ ] lets use cache components
- [ ] login system implementation refinement
- [ ] finish openfga implementation example and structure
- [ ] rate limiting implementation
- [ ] security headers middleware
- [ ] request ID tracking across services

## Medium Priority

- [ ] better first init
- [ ] command to generate components / apps / and other tools
- [ ] a standard way to generate migrations in dev / prod
- [ ] cursor rules
- [ ] add storybook for the components visualization and changing the theme
- [ ] ci / cd pipeline
- [ ] dependency vulnerability scanning (Dependabot / Snyk)
- [ ] code coverage reporting and thresholds
- [ ] license compliance checking
- [ ] changelog management and automation
- [ ] release automation and versioning
- [ ] rollback automation
- [ ] error tracking and alerting (Sentry / Rollbar)
- [ ] distributed tracing implementation (OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] metrics collection and dashboards (Prometheus / Grafana)
- [ ] logging aggregation (ELK / Loki)
- [ ] APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
- [ ] performance budgets and monitoring
- [ ] uptime monitoring and alerting
- [ ] kubernetes optional implementation
- [ ] Don't forget to use the docs from tablecn project to document the types from data-table
- [ ] update the docs with all the changes

## Low Priority

- [ ] mail implementation example and structure
- [ ] polar payment gateway integration and structure
- [ ] metadata should be inside the layout & page
- [ ] sitemap.ts
- [ ] robots.ts
- [ ] i18n

## Cleanup

- [ ] delete this file after the implementations are done
